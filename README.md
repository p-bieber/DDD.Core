# DDD.Core

`DDD.Core` is a core library for a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) project. The library provides basic building blocks and abstractions to simplify development.

## Main Features

- **Entity**: A base class for all entities in the domain, supporting equality checks and identity management.
- **Value Object**: A class for value objects representing immutable data types used to model domain concepts.
- **Event Sourcing**: Support for event sourcing, enabling changes to aggregates to be stored and reconstructed as events.
- **Result Pattern**: An object for representing results and errors, simplifying the implementation of the result pattern.

## Origin and Inspiration
DDD.Core was inspired by the ideas and concepts of Milan JovanoviÄ‡. The principles and approaches implemented in this library are based on the teachings and experiences Milan has shared with his YouTube community.
